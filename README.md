# Face Detection Using MediaPipe

## Overview

This project implements a real-time face detection system using the [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev) framework. MediaPipe provides a fast and efficient pipeline for detecting and tracking faces across video frames. This project is ideal for applications requiring accurate face detection with minimal computational overhead.

## Features

- Real-time face detection
- High accuracy with low latency
- Easy-to-integrate with other computer vision systems
- Supports both video files and webcam input

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hariharasudhanm01/Face-Detection/
   cd face-detection-mediapipe
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Face Detection

To run the face detection on a webcam feed:
```bash
python face_detection.py
```

### Output

The program will display the video with detected faces highlighted by bounding boxes. The number of detected faces is displayed on the screen.

## Project Structure

- `face_detection.py`: Main script for running face detection.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## How It Works

This project leverages MediaPipeâ€™s Face Detection module, which uses machine learning models to detect facial landmarks with high precision. The detected faces are then tracked across frames to ensure real-time performance.

### Key Modules

- **MediaPipe Face Detection**: The core module used for detecting faces.
- **OpenCV**: Used for handling video input and output.
